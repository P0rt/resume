        <h3>Software Engineer. Mar 2017 — Nov 2017</h3>
        <span>
          This was my first experience in development. We built a commercial real estate startup. 
          Together with the back-end developer, we created a project from scratch with 20 screens and a search filter. 
          The database was unique and the project wasn't an aggregator of other listings, but only worked with unique offices/spaces. I also organized processes within the company between business, design, and development. The back-end was built with Django, and the front-end with ReactJS, Redux, etc.

        <h3>Teaching Assistant. Oct 2016 — Aug 2017</h3>
        <span>
          At this school, I supported children in their technological learning, including the use of the Arduino IDE, Swift, and Minecraft Python IDE. During the evenings, I facilitated workshops and sessions with adults, delving into areas such as frontend and backend development and VR mapping. My rapid adaptability to new technologies, coupled with my ability to offer comprehensive support, made me a valuable asset to both children and adult students.
