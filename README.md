### Hey there! This is my tech experience page.
I've set up GitHub Actions on this project, so every time I make a commit to the master branch, it triggers a build and gets deployed at http://p0rt.github.io/resume/.
I made it simple to set up and optimized for different devices, so I hope you'll find it useful to examine the code and get a feel for my experience. Thanks!
